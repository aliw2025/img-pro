The program is based on php laravel
The following packages need to be installed on server to run the code
1  - xampp/ lamp server
2 - python 3
3 - composer
 
1 - Download the code . in the project folder run :
composer install 
the above command will install the code;
2 - Install opencv , skiimage for python 
3- run command php artisan migrate to create table required for file upload

I have also attached new.py file . which is the python file. that is called by the website to perform calculation.

If you are having trouble in creating live server in AWS . or installing it locally . i will install the required packages and code on your local machine.
